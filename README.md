# CryptoWorth
Very small and easy script to output your entire cryptocurrency portfolio in USD using the API from CoinMarketCap.com

Run `install.sh` (maybe with sudo) and then `source ~/.bashrc` to activate it in the current shell.

Just type `worth` into your terminal anytime you feel the itch coming back.
